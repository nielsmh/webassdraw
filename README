WebAssDraw is intended to become a replacement for the older AssDraw
application, which has several problems, not least that it has poor support
for other platforms than Windows.

WebAssDraw is intended to work as a standalone HTML5 application, that won't
need a server-side system to work. Although perhaps an optional server
service could be introduced later, for collaboration and art repository.
